# **Donald's Day Off**

## **Overview**
If you're an individual who's both active outdoors and active politically, _Donald's Day Off_ combines your favorite three activities - golfing, archery, and our president, The Donald! Using only their mouse clicks and cursor positions, players must aim a bow, which once fired, will launch an arrow and our president attached by rope towards a target. What's the goal? Like American foreign policy, players must strike the target using fewest number of shots in this battle of wit, precision, and speed.

## **Technologies**
Donald's Day Off is primarily built using **Vanilla JavaScript**, **CSS**/**HTML5 Canvas** for styling/rendering, and **Webpack** for script bundling. Additional technologies may be added as development continues.
